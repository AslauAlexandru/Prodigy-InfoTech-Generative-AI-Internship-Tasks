# Task 1

## Task-01

## Text Generation with GPT-2

Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Starting with GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI, you will learn how to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.

# Task 2

Task-02

Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

Utilize pre-trained generative models like DALL-E-mini or Stable Diffusion to create images from text prompts.

# Task 3

Task-03

Text Generation with Markov Chains

Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This task involves creating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a character or word based on the previous one(s).

# Task 4

Task-04

Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN

Implement an image-to-image translation model using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) called pix2pix.

# Task 5

Task-05

Style Transfer

Apply the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) to the content of another image using neural style transfer. 

Ref: [#1](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-neural-style-transfers-work-b76de101eb3)   [#2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/neural-style-transfer-with-tensorflow/)   [#3](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer)
